## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and their may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will not discuss here). 
##Your assignment is to write a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m<-NULL
  set<-function(y){
  x<<-y
  m<<-NULL
}
get<-function() x
setmatrix<-function(solve) m<<- solve
getmatrix<-function() m
list(set=set, get=get,
   setmatrix=setmatrix,
   getmatrix=getmatrix)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
cacheSolve <- function(x=matrix(), ...) {
    m<-x$getmatrix()
    if(!is.null(m)){
      message("getting cached data")
      return(m)
    }
    matrix<-x$get()
    m<-solve(matrix, ...)
    x$setmatrix(m)
   m
   }
